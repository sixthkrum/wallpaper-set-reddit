# wallpaper-set-reddit
Set your wallpaper to the top hourly reddit post on a subreddit of your choosing.

### Requirements
Works on any distro using gnome (Not a 100% on this. Only been tested on debian :p)

Just needs python 3.x

### Setup
Run setup.py in the directory you have downloaded this into to set the paths automatically and set the subreddit to get images from

! There are no checks for the subreddit you have entered, please make sure the name is correct or this won't work !

### Usage
Run wallpaper-cron-script after running setup.py to change the wallpaper

### Scheduling
Just make a normal entry in cron (or any other scheduler you like) and it will chug right along, nothing extra needed
